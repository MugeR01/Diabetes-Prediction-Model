# Diabetes-Prediction-Model
This was a simple Machine Learning project that looks into applying Classification Models on a Diabetes sample Data.
So various classification models like KNNs,Logistic Regression, Decision Trees were used in order to look at which model would fit and predict well with the data.
Various efficiency score swere looked at in order to qualify the models.
